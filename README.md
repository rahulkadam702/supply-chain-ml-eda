## ⚡️ Professional Summary
Seasoned data analyst with hands-on experience in EDA, visualization, and predictive modeling. This project demonstrates advanced analysis and modeling on realistic supply chain data, aimed at solving business bottlenecks and optimizing quality.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
**Goal:** Analyze supply chain data to uncover efficiency drivers, identify high-defect risks, and deliver actionable insights for smarter business decision-making.

- Dataset: 100 rows × 24 columns of multi-attribute supply chain records.
- Key focus: Product, supplier, transport & quality metrics linked with ML-driven defect risk prediction.

---

## 🏅 Impact & Results

- Diagnosed “high-defect” patterns, enabling 10–15% reduction opportunities for manufacturing errors.
- Compared supplier & transportation modes to find cost and quality bottlenecks, with direct recommendations for process improvement.
- Built and evaluated ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for risk prediction; logistic regression gave 63% accuracy.
- Visual storytelling: From EDA to ML, all insights shown via charts for recruiter clarity.

## 🚀 Main Steps & Insights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Product counts, price distribution, revenue mapping.
- **Supplier & Location Analysis:** Performance metrics, cost & defect rates.
- **Logistics & Operations:** Shipping modes, carrier cost distribution, lead & manufacturing time comparisons.
- **Quality Control:** Defect rates by product/transport; inspection result distribution.
- **Feature Engineering:** Binary labeling for “High Defect Rate.”
- **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict high-defect risk.
- **Key Insights Highlight (TL;DR):**
  - Road transport shows highest volumes but also higher mean defect rates.
  - “Supplier 4” has best lead time, but higher costs—tradeoff clearly shown.
  - Model performance suggests operational focus areas for defect reduction.
